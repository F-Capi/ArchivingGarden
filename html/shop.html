    <p id="par1">Non-profit organizations rely heavily on financial donations to cover their operating costs. Projects
        like
        Wikipedia,
        built by volunteer contributors, run on donations to pay for server hosting, staff, and other expenses required
        to
        keep the platform running and information freely accessible. The Internet Archive is another key non-profit that
        archives billions of web pages, books, videos, and more through initiatives like the Wayback Machine, preventing
        loss of digital content - their operations also depend on public donations and partnerships. Groups like these
        can
        only continue their important work thanks to monetary contributions from individuals, companies, and
        grant-making
        institutions that value open access to information worldwide.</p>
    <p id="par2">We are committed to donating 50% of our monthly merchandising revenue to non-profit internet archive
        organizations.
        This contribution supports their vital work in preserving and providing global access to digital content.</p>
